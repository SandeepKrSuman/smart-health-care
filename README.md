# Smart Health Care System

The Smart Health Care System is an application that takes health data as an input from the authenticated user analyzes the data in the background and generates alerts corresponding to the health condition of the user. For example, if the heart rate or blood pressure goes beyond threshold limit, it will make a call to nearby hospital for medical assistance.

### Run the APP Locally

Go to the project directory and run the following command from the terminal:

```javascript
npm install && npm start
```

The APP will run on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

_Note: In order for authentication functionality to work properly, create a `.env` file in the root of project directory and copy your **Firebase** credentials(keys) in it. Look at the [.env.example](/.env.example) file for reference._
